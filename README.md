# Fish-food-detection
 This project is to detect fish food(petals) floating on the top of the water. For the image detection we use YOLO custom object detection. In which we train our model with 40 images(very less, for more accurate model we need to increase the number of images (at least 100)). Our dataset contain images and a text file which contain the coordinates of the fish food in that image(which is already labelled manually). For labelling our images we used labelimg(https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg).
